# Welcome to 20 days game challenge!

## The goal of this challenge is to make a simple terminal game without any gamedew experience. Everyday I will post sources with information I used and my steps to reach the goal.

### Idea:

The idea is to make platform game with the symbol character, who can move around, jump and shot enemies.
Enemies will appear from left and right sides of the game screen. Will be some save blocks with health
regeneration and weapons upgrade.
